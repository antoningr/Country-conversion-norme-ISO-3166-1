# Country conversion (norme ISO 3166-1)


## Introduction

### Description of the project
The project aims to provide dictionaries to convert ISO 3166-1 codes (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, alpha-3 and numeric) with their corresponding country names in two languages (English and French).

These projects can be useful for developers who need to convert ISO 3166-1 codes into country names in their applications, without having to write a conversion list themselves. They can also be useful for ensuring the consistency and accuracy of country data in applications.

However, it is important to note that these dictionaries or libraries may not be up to date with the latest changes in country or territory names. It is therefore important to check them regularly or update them with the latest information from the ISO 3166-1 standard.


### The ISO 3166-1 standard
ISO 3166-1 is an international standard that defines two-letter, three-letter and three-digit country codes for the countries and territories of the world. It is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is updated regularly to reflect changes in country or territory names.

The two-letter code is often used in Internet addresses for specific countries, while the three-letter code is used for applications that require more detailed country identification, such as trade. The three-digit code is used for statistical applications and is often used for countries or regions that are not recognized as sovereign entities.

The ISO 3166-1 standard is used by many organizations, governments, businesses and international agencies to identify countries and territories. It is widely used in the fields of logistics, international trade, finance, health, transportation, research and statistics.

It is important to note that ISO 3166-1 does not define the boundaries or sovereignty of countries or territories. It simply provides a standardized method for identifying countries and territories in computer and statistical applications.

- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 – two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the three,[citation needed] and used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions).
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter country codes which allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes.
- ISO 3166-1 numeric – three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts.
